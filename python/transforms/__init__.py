
"""
This module is to support common data augmentations. Some operations are implemented in C++
to provide high performance.
Other operations are implemented in Python including using NumPy.

Common imported modules in corresponding API examples are as follows:

.. code-block::

    import .dataset as ds
    import .dataset.transforms as transforms

Descriptions of common data processing terms are as follows:

- TensorOperation, the base class of all data processing operations implemented in C++.
- PyTensorOperation, the base class of all data processing operations implemented in Python.
